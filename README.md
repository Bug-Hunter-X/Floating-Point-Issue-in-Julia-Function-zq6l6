# Julia Floating Point Bug
This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to floating-point number handling in a Julia function. The function `myfunction` is intended to square the input, returning a positive value for positive inputs and a negative value for negative inputs. However, due to floating-point precision limitations, it produces unexpected results for certain inputs, particularly those close to zero.

## Bug Description
The `myfunction` behaves incorrectly for floating-point numbers extremely close to zero.  This may lead to incorrect results when calculations demand higher precision than what's offered by the standard floating-point representation.

## Solution
The provided solution involves using a tolerance value to handle near-zero cases correctly.
